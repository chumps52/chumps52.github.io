          <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
          <p class="lead">TAVI Heart Team App has been built as a commercial application. This SERVICE is provided by William Redwood, Dr Christopher Allen, and other associated research fellows (collectively "the developers"), and is intended for
            use as-is. Hereafter, the developers may also be referred to as “We”, “Us”, "Our", "Me", "I".</p>
          <p class="lead">Hereafter, TAVI Heart Team App may also be referred to as "this application" or "the application".</p>
          <hr>

          <p class="info">By downloading or using this application, these Terms & Conditions will automatically apply to you - therefore, you should ensure to read them carefully before using the application.</p>

          <p class="info">The user may not copy or modify the app, or any part of the app or any associated trademarks, in any way. The user must not attempt to extract the source code of the app, or translate the app into other languages, or make
            derivative versions. The app itself, and any associated trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it belong to the developers.</p>

          <p class="info">The developers are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We
            will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for. The developers have endeavoured to present the information in this application in a form which is as complete and
            accurate as possible, but do not warrant or represent either that it is complete or accurate.</p>

          <p class="info">With respect to the developers' responsibility for a user's use of the application, when the application is in use it is important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
            times, we do rely on third-parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. The developers accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, a user may experience as a result of relying wholly on the
            functionality of the application. The user hereby indemnifies the authors, developers, and publishers of the app against any and all loss and damages (including, but not limited to; consequential, direct, indirect, special, punitive or
            incidental damages and damages or losses of any other kind) howsoever arising from any cause whatsoever arising out of or relation to the use of this application or the information contained therein. The information and content contained
            in this application, including text, diagrams. and illustrations, is to be used for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for sound clinical judgment or professional advice.</p>

          <p class="info">Although all advertising material contained within the application is expected to conform to expected ethical and medical standards, inclusion does not represent a guarantee or endorsement of the publisher of either the
            quality or value of such a product or of the claim made by the manufacturer.</p>

          <p class="info">Any statements made about commercial products are solely the opinion of the authors and do not constitute an endorsement or evaluation of these products. These statements should not be used in advertising or for any
            commercial purpose.</p>

          <p class="info">At some point, we may wish to release updates for the application. The application is currently available on iOS and macOS - the requirements for these systems, and any additional systems we may decide to extend the
            availablity of the application to, may change, and the user will need to download any applicable updates should they wish to continue using the application. The developers do not promise to always update the application so that it is
            relevant to the user and/or works with the user's specific device.
            We may also wish to stop providing the application, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to the user. Unless we tell the user otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
            the user in these terms will end; (b) the user must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from their device.</p>

          <p class="info">The developers do not take responsibility for the application not working at full functionality should the user not have an active internet connection. If using the application in an area outside of Wi-Fi coverage, the user
            should remember that their terms of agreement with their mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, the user may be charged by their mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
            application, or other third-party charges. In using the application, the user is accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if they were use the app outside of their home territory (i.e. region or
            country) without turning off data roaming. If the user is not the bill payer for the device on which they are using the app, please be aware that we assume that the user has received permission from the bill payer for using the
            application.</p>

          <p class="info">The developers cannot always take responsibility for the way the user uses the application. For example, it is the user's responsibility to ensure their device remains charged - if it runs out of battery and they cannot turn
            it on to avail the Service, the developers cannot accept responsibility.</p>

          <p class="info">The application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide the service. It is the user's responsibility to keep their phone and access to the application secure. We therefore
            recommend against users jailbreaking or otherwise modifying their devices, which, as a process, involves removing software restrictions/limitations imposed by the official operating system of their device. The developers do not guarantee
            that, should the user jailbreak or otherwise modify their device, the application would continue to work as expected.</p>

          <p class="info">The application also uses third-party services that declare their own Terms & Conditions, and these may be found here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms">https://firebase.google.com/terms</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Changes to these Terms</h3>
          <p class="info">We may update our Terms & Conditions from time to time. Thus, users are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms & Conditions on this page.</p>

          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p class="lead">TAVI Heart Team App has been built as a commercial application. This SERVICE is provided by William Redwood, Dr Christopher Allen, and other associated research fellows (collectively "the developers"), and is intended for
            use as-is. Hereafter, the developers may also be referred to as “We”, “Us”, "Our", "Me", "I".</p>
          <p class="lead">This page is used to inform visitors regarding the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for those who decide to use this service.</p>
          <p class="lead">If you choose to use this service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this Privacy Policy. The personal information collected is used for providing and improving the service. Information
            will not be used or shared with anyone, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p class="lead">The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in the Terms & Conditions.</p>
          <hr>

          <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
          <p class="info">For a better experience while using the service, users may be required to provide certain personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, their full name, email address, profession, institution, and
            country of work.</p>
          <p class="info">Certain third-party services are also used, and they may collect information used to identify users. Their respective Privacy Policies may be found here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>nAnonymised Research Data</h3>
          <p class="info">The application may also collect anonymised patient records should a user not opt-out (or opt-in) through the in-app settings after this onboarding process (About tab -> User profile). This would be collected for the
            purposes outlined below.</p>
          <p class="info">These will have the Patient ID randomised, and any ECG scan images removed, to reduce the chance of any records being recognised.</p>
          <p class="info">The collected data would be used for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To correlate patient and device selection with real-world outcomes.</li>
            <li>To enable the identification and testing of novel risk variables or scores, to help improve the evaluation of patients undergoing consideration for TAVI/valve intervention.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="info">Any information which is collected during the course of this research will be kept strictly confidential. The information we analyse for the results will be anonymous. The information will be kept for up to twelve months
            after the research has been completed, before being destroyed. Any data will be kept securely, as outlined in the "Security" section of this policy below. These steps mitigate any potential risks to user who opt-in.</p>
          <p class="info">If you opt-in to anonymised patient record collection, but later opt-out, the developers are not automatically notified. No further records are collected by the developers, but any previously-collected records may not be
            deleted. Should a user desire that previously-collected records are deleted, please contact us using the details at the bottom of this page.</p>
          <p class="info">Likewise, should a user have any questions regarding this, please feel free to contact us using the details at the bottom of this page.</p>

          <h3>Usage/Log Data</h3>
          <p class="info">The standard collected data may be used for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the service, including to monitor usage of the service.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Retention of collected data</h3>
          <p class="info">Data will be retained only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Personal data will be retained and used to the extent necessary to comply with legal obligations (such as if retention
            is required to comply with applicable laws), to resolve disputes, and to enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
          <p class="info">Usage/log data will also be retained for internal analysis purposes. This data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is required to strengthen the security or improve the functionality of
            the service, or if there is a legal obligation to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p class="info">All information is transmitted and stored using Firebase services, which have all, at the very least, successfully completed the ISO 27001 and SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 evaluation process.</p>
          <p class="info">This data may then be processed at our respective operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means that this information may be transferred to, and maintained on,
            computers located outside of your state, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy, followed by your usage of the application and
            subsequent submission of any information, represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
          <p class="info">We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that user's data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and that no transfer of user's data will take place to an organisation or a country
            unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of user's data and other personal information.</p>

          <h3>Links to other sites</h3>
          <p class="info">This service may contain links to other websites. If a user clicks on a third-party link, they will be directed to that site. These sites, unless specified otherwise, are not operated by William Redwood or their associates.
            It is therefore the user's responsibility to review the Privacy Policy of these websites, as we have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

          <h3>Children's privacy</h3>
          <p class="info">These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case that we discover that a child under 13 has provided
            us with personal information, this will be immediately deleted this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that this can be
            actioned accordingly.</p>

          <h3>Data subject rights</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>The right to be informed; meaning anyone processing your personal data must make clear what they are processing, why, and who else the data may be passed to.</li>
            <li>The right of access; this is your right to see what data is held about you by a Data Controller.</li>
            <li>The right to rectification; the right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect in some way.</li>
            <li>The right to erasure; under certain circumstances you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. This is also called ‘the Right to be Forgotten’. This would apply if the personal data is no longer required for the purposes it
              was
              collected for, or your consent for the processing of that data has been withdrawn, or the personal data has been unlawfully processed.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing; this gives the Data Subject the right to ask for a temporary halt to processing of personal data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has to be concluded, or the data is being
              corrected.</li>
            <li>The right to data portability; a Data Subject has the right to ask for any data supplied directly to the Data Controller by him or her, to be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.</li>
            <li>The right to object; the Data Subject has the right to object to further processing of their data which is inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected, including profiling, automation, and direct marketing.
            </li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling; Data Subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="info">If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as noted below.</p>
